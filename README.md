## Accomplishments
We feel accomplished about creating a project which connects and includes all necessary features to help New Yorkers thrive in their local community and foster a sense of community. Although we have had a great start with this application, we would like to expand upon some key features to incorporate all new Yorkers. For one we would like to expand upon our accessibility features making it easier to determine what events are accessible and different ways they are accessible. additionally we would like to incorporate more personalized notification and event recommendations that can provide insights on different events occurring locally our event recommendations will take into consideration various factors about our users including their interests and their proximity to events to provide the best recommendations.
